# RACEkNN
A hybrid approach for improving the effectiveness of the k-nearest neighbor algorithm
Our study introduces RACEkNN, a novel hybrid approach that strategically combines the strengths of kNN with RACERâ€™s rule-based classification in a multi-phase process. This unique integration aims to significantly enhance both computational efficiency and classification accuracy in data-driven decision-making. RACEkNN not only substantially reduces computational costs but also improves the accuracy of predictions. On average, it has reduced execution time by 62.6% and 95.4% compared to kNN and RACER, respectively. Furthermore, it has increased accuracy by 10.8% and 5.3%, respectively. Our comparative analysis against four well-known classifiers further underscores RACEkNN's superior performance across diverse datasets.
